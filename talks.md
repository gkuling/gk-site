## Talks and Presentations  

I regularly share my work at conferences, symposia, and academic workshops focused on AI in medicine, neuroscience, and higher education. My talks emphasize both the technical and pedagogical dimensions of AI—how new computational tools can expand understanding, enhance transparency, and make learning more reflective and inclusive.
